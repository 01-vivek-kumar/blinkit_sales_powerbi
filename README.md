# 🌟 Blinkit Grocery Sales Dashboard

## 📚 Project Overview

I recently worked on a **Power BI project** where I analyzed grocery sales data for Blinkit. The goal was to find out which products sell the most, how different stores perform, and what insights could help improve sales.

This dashboard helped me understand how sales vary based on product type, outlet size, and even location. I’m sharing my learnings here—hope you find it helpful!

## 📊 About the Dataset  

The dataset had information about grocery items sold at Blinkit, including details like:  

- **Product Information:** Item type, fat content (low fat or regular), visibility, and MRP.  
- **Sales Details:** Total sales, number of items sold, and average rating.  
- **Outlet Information:** Outlet size (small, medium, large), location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3), type, and establishment year.


## 🎯 What Was the Goal?

The project had three main goals:  

1. **Understand Sales Trends:** What kind of products are people buying more?  
2. **Evaluate Outlet Performance:** Do bigger stores sell more? Do older outlets perform better?  
3. **Find Actionable Insights:** What can Blinkit do to increase sales based on the current trends?

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before diving into the dashboard, I had to make sure the data was clean and ready for analysis. Here's what I did:

1. **Removed Duplicates & Nulls:** This made sure the data was accurate and consistent.  
2. **Standardized Formats:** I cleaned up column names and converted data types to avoid errors.  
3. **Built Relationships:** I connected tables properly in Power BI to get accurate cross-table insights.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

Here’s what I included in the dashboard to make the analysis meaningful:

### 🔑 Key Metrics (KPIs)
To quickly understand overall sales performance, I added these KPIs:

- 🟢 **Total Sales:** $1.20 million  
- 📦 **Total Items Sold:** 8,523  
- 💰 **Average Sales per Item:** $141  
- ⭐ **Average Rating:** 3.9

### 📈 Visual Breakdown
To analyze the dataset, I broke it down into two main segments:  

### 🥑 1. Sales by Fat Content  

For this part, I focused on understanding how product fat content (Low Fat vs. Regular) affected sales. I used the following metrics:  

- **Total Sales**  
- **Average Sales per Item**  
- **Number of Items Sold**  
- **Average Rating**  

Here’s how I visualized the insights:  

- **Pie Chart:** To compare total sales, average sales, number of items, and average rating by fat content. I added the metrics as values and fat content as the legend.  
- **Clustered Bar Chart:** To show how fat content varied across different outlets.  
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** To analyze fat content along with item types.

### 🏪 2. Outlet Analysis  

Next, I explored how sales differed based on outlet characteristics. Here’s what I did:  

- **Line Chart:** To show sales by outlet establishment year. It was interesting to see that newer outlets didn’t always perform better.  
- **Pie Chart:** To break down sales by outlet size (small, medium, large).  
- **Funnel Chart:** To visualize sales by outlet location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).  
- **Matrix:** To compare outlet type with all four key metrics—total sales, average sales, average rating, and item visibility.

## 🎛️ Interactive Features  

To make the dashboard more user-friendly, I added **slicers** to filter data by:  

1. **Outlet Location**  
2. **Outlet Size**  
3. **Item Type**  

This made it super easy to drill down into specific areas and find patterns.

## 🔍 What Did I Find?

Here are some interesting things I discovered while working on this project:

1. **Fat Content Matters:**  
   - *Regular* items made up about **70% of total sales**, while *Low Fat* contributed only **30%**.  
   - Most regular items were sold in *Tier 3* outlets, while *Tier 1* outlets leaned towards low-fat products.  

2. **Product Category Insights:**  
   - *Fruits & Vegetables* and *Snack Foods* were the top sellers.  
   - *Breakfast* and *Seafood* items didn’t perform as well, which means Blinkit might need to promote them more.  

3. **Outlet Performance:**  
   - **Tier 3 locations** generated the highest sales (**$472K**), followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1.  
   - **Medium-sized outlets** led sales with **$507K**, outperforming both small and large ones.  

4. **Outlet Type:**  
   - *Supermarket Type 1* was the real winner here, generating **$787K** in sales and selling **5.5K items**.

## 💡 What Can Blinkit Do?

Based on the analysis, I came up with a few suggestions:

1. **Promote Regular Items:** Since they make up most sales, Blinkit could run more promotions or bundle offers, especially in Tier 3 outlets.  
2. **Boost Low-Performing Categories:** Categories like *Breakfast* and *Seafood* might benefit from discounts or better visibility.  
3. **Expand Medium-Sized Outlets:** These stores performed the best, so it might make sense to open more of them.  
4. **Focus on Supermarket Type 1:** This outlet type already leads in sales, so investing more here could drive even better results.
